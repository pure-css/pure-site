    {{sectionHeading "Vertical Menu"}}
    <p>
        Menus are vertical by default. Minimal default styling and low-specificity
        selectors make them easy to customize. By default, menu items take up
        100% of the width of their container, so you may want to limit the menu
        width or set the menu to display:inline-block.
    </p>

    {{sectionHeading "Horizontal Menu"}}
    <p>
        To create a horizontal menu, add the {{code "pure-menu-horizontal"}} class name.
    </p>

    {{> menus/horizontal}}

    {{#code}}
      {{> menus/horizontal}}
    {{/code}}

    {{sectionHeading "Selected and Disabled Items"}}
    <p>
        Mark a selected list element by adding the {{code "pure-menu-selected"}} class to the list element. To mark a link as disabled, add an {{code "<a>"}} element with the {{code "pure-menu-disabled"}} class name. Disabled items appear faded and do not inherit hover styles.
    </p>

    {{> menus/disabled}}

    {{#code}}
      {{> menus/disabled}}
    {{/code}}


    {{sectionHeading "Dropdowns"}}
    <p>
        We recommend enabling submenus via JavaScript to improve accessibility.
        To help get you started, <a href="/js/menus.js">an example script</a>
        written in vanilla JS provides ARIA support, keyboard navigation, and
        the ability to dismiss menus with an outside event or the ESC key. This script
        is incomplete, however: it lacks edge detection logic, the keyboard
        navigation could be improved, and, because it's vanilla JS, it won't work
        in older browsers without polyfills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even with JavaScript in place, you still might want to display submenus on hover. Just add
        {{code "pure-menu-allow-hover"}} to the {{code "pure-menu-has-children"}}
        list item.
    </p>

    {{> menus/dropdown}}

      {{> menus/dropdown}}
    {{/code}}


    {{sectionHeading "Submenus"}}

    <p>
        The same construct used to create dropdowns works in vertical menus as well. You
        can nest submenus, but this can lead to usability issues on mobile. You may also
        require JavaScript to intelligently position the menus in response to window
        boundaries.

    {{> menus/submenu}}

    {{#code}}
      {{> menus/submenu}}
    {{/code}}

    {{sectionHeading "Scrollable Horizontal Menu"}}
    <p>
        To create a scrollable horizontal menu, add the {{code "pure-menu-scrollable"}} class name. When
        there isn't enough room, the menu items can be scrolled or flicked. Dropdown menus are not supported.
    </p>

    {{> menus/horizontal-scroll}}

    {{#code}}
      {{> menus/horizontal-scroll}}
    {{/code}}

    {{sectionHeading "Scrollable Vertical Menu"}}
    <p>
        To create a scrollable vertical menu, limit the height of your menu, and then add the {{code "pure-menu-scrollable"}} class name. The menu items can be scrolled or flicked. Submenus are not supported.
    </p>

    {{> menus/vertical-scroll}}

    {{#code}}
      {{> menus/vertical-scroll}}
    {{/code}}

    {{sectionHeading "Responsive Menus That Hide"}}
    <p>
        Check out our <a href="/layouts/">Layout Examples</a> to see how you can use
        Pure as a foundation for more complex menus, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/layouts/side-menu/">Responsive Vertical Menu</a>, which
        collapses behind a hamburger,
        similar to the menu on this Pure website.</li>
        <li><a href="/layouts/tucked-menu/">Responsive Horizontal-Scrollable Menu</a>,
        which tucks out of the way on small screens.</li>
        <li><a href="/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/">Responsive Horizontal-to-Vertical Menu</a>,
        which slides out of view.</li>
    </ul>

</div>
